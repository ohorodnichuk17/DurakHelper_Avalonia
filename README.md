The "Durak" Game Assistant is a program designed to provide assistance to players in the well-known card game "Durak". The program is implemented using the Avalonia UI Framework, which enables the creation of a graphical user interface.

Program Features:

Card Display:
The program allows players to display playing cards on the game field.
Each card is presented as a button with the corresponding image of the card.
Upon clicking a card, the image changes to a cross, aiding players in marking the card they intend to discard.

Player's Helper:
The assistant can help players determine which cards are still in the game, enabling them to make more thoughtful moves based on this information.
To achieve this, the program can mark cards on the game field that have been discarded by players or are already on the table.
This provides players with the ability to better assess the probabilities of certain cards coming up and make decisions based on this information.
